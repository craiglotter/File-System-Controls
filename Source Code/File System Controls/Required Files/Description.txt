File System Controls

File System Controls is essentially a Windows Explorer emulator with certain features crippled by design. File System Controls was developed to be used in a later Student Handin project for Commerce I.T. It allows almost full functionality as the real Windows Explorer apart from file deletions and root parent directory exploring. File deletions have been disabled due to the file system restrictions in place on the network server on which the project is to be implemented and has instead been replaced with a 'Recycle Bin' concept.
